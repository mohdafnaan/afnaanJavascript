// Loops 
/* Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true.
   they help avoid writing the same code multiple times.

   There are 2 types
   1. Basic loops
   2. Advanced loops

    Basic loop : for loop, while loop, do while loop, 
    */

    // for loop :
    // Runs a block of code a specific number of times.
    // Syntax for..... forloop : 

    // for (initiable, condition, increment)
    //{
    //code to repeat
    //}

    //1. initialize ===> where t start
    //2. condition checks always for true to execute code block
    //3. code block(what to repeat
    //4. increment the number

    for (let i = 1; i <=5; i++)
    {
        console.log("hello",i)
    }
